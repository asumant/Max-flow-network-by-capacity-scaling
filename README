	Summary:
	---------
	Informally, the main idea of the algorithm is to augment the flow along paths 
	with sufficient large capacities, instead of augmenting along maximal capacities. 
	More formally, let's introduce a parameter Delta. First, Delta is quite a large 
	number such that it is a nearest power of two lesser than or equal to maximum 
	capacity in a graph. The algorithm tries to find an augmenting path with capacity 
	not less that Delta, then augments flow along this path and repeats this procedure 
	while any such Delta-path exists in the residual network. 
	
	Program implementation uses dynamic memory allocation for adjacency list creation,
	path bookkeeping and all other data structure needs.
	
	Language of Implementation:
	---------------------------
	This program in implemented in C.

	Instructions to run:
	---------------------
	To execute this program, perform following steps.

	$ cd Max-flow-network-by-capacity-scaling/
	$ make
	$ ./run

	Algorithms implemented:
	-----------------------
	Following are the algorithms implemented in this program. These are all the building
	blocks for Max flow Capacity Scaling Algorithm.

	1. Delta calculation: This algorithm calculated delta from maximum capacity channel
	   in graph.

	2. BFS Traversal of Graph: On each iteration after delta = delta/2, we should find 
	   if there exist a source to sink path. BFS is used for finding this path in graph.
	
	3. Bottleneck: finding a minimum capacity of source-sink path selected by BFS.

	4. Augment path: Create residual graph G' depending on flow value on selected path.

	5. Calculate min-cut: This algorithm runs BFS on residual graph G' on graph at the 
	   end of max flow calculation to divide set of vertices {V} into Source set S and 
	   sink set T.
